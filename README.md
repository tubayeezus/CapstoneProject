   - Open a web browser and navigate to the Google Colab website: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Sign in with Google**:
   - Sign in to your Google account if you're not already signed in.

3. **Open the Notebook**:
   - Click on "File" > "Open notebook."
   - In the "GitHub" tab, enter the URL of this project's GitHub repository.

   Example Repository URL:
https://github.com/yourusername/capstone-project

Copy code

- Select the notebook file you want to run (e.g., `capstone_project.ipynb`). The notebook will open in Google Colab.

## Running the Notebook

4. **Mount Google Drive**:
- To access the image dataset and necessary files, you need to mount your Google Drive. Execute the following code cell at the beginning of the notebook:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Follow the prompts to authenticate and mount Google Drive.
Upload the Dataset Folder:

Download the dataset folder from the project's GitHub repository to your local machine. You can find it in the "Dataset" section of the repository.
After downloading, log in to your Google Drive and upload the entire dataset folder to any location in your Google Drive that you prefer.
Specify the Dataset Path:

In the notebook, locate the code cell that specifies the path to the dataset. It should look similar to this:
python
Copy code
dataset_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/your_dataset_folder'
Update your_dataset_folder with the actual path to the dataset folder you uploaded to your Google Drive.
Install Dependencies:

The required Python libraries are specified in the notebook. You can install them by running the provided code cell.
Running the Notebook Cells:

Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially by clicking the "Run" button or using keyboard shortcuts.
Follow the notebook instructions to train models, visualize results, and make predictions.
